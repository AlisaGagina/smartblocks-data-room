## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Private GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository (e.g., `data-room-site`)
5. **Important**: Set visibility to "Private"
6. Initialize with README (optional, since we have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Upload Your Files

#### Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface
1. In your new repository, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop or select these files:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `README.md`
3. Add a commit message like "Initial data room website setup"
4. Click "Commit changes"

#### Option B: Using Git Commands
```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME

# Copy your files to the repository directory
# Then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Initial data room website setup"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. In your repository, go to "Settings" tab
2. Scroll down to "Pages" section (left sidebar)
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "main" branch
5. Select "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"
7. GitHub will provide your site URL (usually: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`)

**Note**: Since this is a private repository, GitHub Pages is only available with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, or GitHub Enterprise. For free accounts, you'll need to make the repository public to use GitHub Pages.

### 4. Access Your Site

After enabling GitHub Pages, your site will be available at:
```
https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name
```

It may take a few minutes for the site to become available after the initial setup.

## File Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # CSS styling (SmartBlocks inspired)
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           # JavaScript for interactivity
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # This file
```

## Customization

### Updating Content
- Edit `index.html` to change text, team members, and sections
- Modify `styles.css` to adjust colors, fonts, and layout
- Update `script.js` for additional functionality

### Color Scheme
The site uses a modern dark theme with these primary colors:
- Background: `#0a0a0a`
- Secondary: `#0f0f0f`
